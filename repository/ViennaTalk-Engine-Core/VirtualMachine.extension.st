	"Optional. Answer the string for the system attribute with the given 
	integer ID. Answer nil if the given attribute is not defined on this 
	platform. On platforms that support invoking programs from command 
	lines (e.g., Unix), this mechanism can be used to pass command line 
	arguments to programs written in Pharo.

	By convention, the first command line argument that is not a VM
	configuration option is considered a 'document' to be filed in. Such a
	document can add methods and classes, can contain a serialized object,
	can include code to be executed, or any combination of these.

	Currently defined attributes include: 
	-1000   1000th command line argument that specify VM options
